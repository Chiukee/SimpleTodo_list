# Project 1 - *Simple todo list*

**Simple todo list** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Chinazor Ukeekwe**

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] I'm not sure what else I can do to improve the app, maybe I can have numbers be automatically entered beside each entry so that if the todo lit gets too long, 
the user will automatically know how many items are in the list without having to count the number of tasks.

## Notes

Many times it was unclear that many of the libraries/files I was using was outdated, and when the project had a lot of errors and wouldn't compile, 
I would be confused.
